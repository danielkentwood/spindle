Your task is to analyze the provided text, understand its overarching purpose and domain, and recommend an appropriate ontology (entity types and relation types) that would be suitable for extracting knowledge from this and similar texts.\n\n    {{ _.role(\"user\") }}\n    \n    TEXT TO ANALYZE:\n    {{ text }}\n    \n    ONTOLOGY SCOPE: {{ scope }}\n    \n    GRANULARITY GUIDELINES:\n    \n    Your goal is to design an ontology with {{ scope }} scope. Use these principles to guide your decisions about how many types to create and how granular to make them.\n    \n    ENTITY TYPE GRANULARITY PRINCIPLES:\n    \n    1. **Abstraction Level**: Choose the right level of abstraction\n       - Too broad: \"Thing\", \"Entity\" (not useful)\n       - Too narrow: \"SoftwareEngineerAtGoogle\", \"CEOOfTechStartup\" (overfitting)\n       - Just right: \"Person\", \"Organization\", \"JobRole\" (reusable across instances)\n    \n    2. **Domain Relevance**: Include entity types that are central to THIS domain\n       - For medical text: Patient, Medication, Condition, Procedure, Hospital\n       - For business text: Company, Person, Investment, Product, Market\n       - Don't include types that rarely appear or aren't relevant to this specific text\n    \n    3. **Distinctiveness Test**: Only create separate types if they have:\n       - Different attributes or characteristics\n       - Different relationship patterns\n       - Different analytical value\n       - Example: \"Professor\" and \"Student\" are distinct if their relationships differ\n       - Example: \"CEO\" and \"CTO\" might both be \"ExecutiveRole\" if relationships are similar\n    \n    4. **Generalization**: Combine similar concepts under broader types when appropriate\n       - Instead of: \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\" → use \"Animal\" (if distinctions don't matter)\n       - Instead of: \"Laptop\", \"Desktop\", \"Tablet\" → use \"Device\" or \"Computer\"\n       - BUT: Keep separate if the distinction is analytically important for this domain\n    \n    5. **Coverage**: Ensure types cover the main concepts in the text\n       - Don't create types for concepts that appear only once\n       - DO create types for recurring or structurally important concepts\n       - Focus on concepts that are central to understanding this domain\n    \n    RELATION TYPE GRANULARITY PRINCIPLES:\n    \n    1. **Semantic Precision**: Relations should capture meaningful distinctions\n       - Too vague: \"related_to\", \"associated_with\" (not informative)\n       - Too specific: \"works_at_as_senior_engineer_since_2020\" (overfitting)\n       - Just right: \"works_at\", \"employed_by\", \"manages\" (clear semantics)\n    \n    2. **Directionality Matters**: Choose direction that reflects real-world semantics\n       - \"Person works_at Organization\" (natural)\n       - Not \"Organization employs Person\" (unless that's the focus)\n       - Be consistent in your directional choices\n    \n    3. **Relationship Patterns**: Include relations that appear or could appear multiple times\n       - Medical: \"treats\", \"prescribes\", \"diagnoses\", \"hospitalized_at\"\n       - Business: \"invests_in\", \"founded\", \"acquired_by\", \"partners_with\"\n       - Focus on the relationships that matter for this domain\n    \n    4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't create near-synonyms unless there's semantic distinction\n       - Don't have both \"works_at\" and \"employed_by\" (pick one)\n       - Don't have both \"located_in\" and \"based_in\" (pick one)\n       - DO have \"founded\" and \"acquired\" (different events with different meanings)\n    \n    5. **Completeness**: Capture the key relationship types in the domain\n       - Think: \"What questions would someone ask about this data?\"\n       - Include relations that support those analytical questions\n       - Every relation should serve a clear analytical purpose\n    \n    SCOPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n    \n    **If scope is \"minimal\":**\n    - Create only the most essential entity types (core concepts only)\n    - Focus on the most frequent and important relationships\n    - Err on the side of broader categories that combine similar concepts\n    - Typical result: 3-8 entity types, 4-10 relation types\n    - Use case: Quick extraction, simple queries, identifying broad patterns\n    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, works_at, located_in\n    \n    **If scope is \"balanced\":**\n    - Include entity types for all significant concepts in the domain\n    - Capture the main relationship patterns without over-specifying\n    - Balance specificity with reusability across similar texts\n    - Typical result: 6-12 entity types, 8-15 relation types\n    - Use case: Standard analysis, general-purpose extraction, most common scenarios\n    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, Product, Investment, works_at, located_in, founded, invests_in, develops\n    \n    **If scope is \"comprehensive\":**\n    - Include entity types for all distinct and meaningful concepts\n    - Capture nuanced relationship types that reflect domain expertise\n    - Allow for more domain-specific and specialized types\n    - Typical result: 10-20 entity types, 12-25 relation types\n    - Use case: Detailed analysis, domain expertise, research, specialized queries\n    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, Product, Investment, Technology, Market, Role, works_at, located_in, founded, invests_in, develops, competes_with, targets, acquired_by, partners_with\n    \n    QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:\n    - It's better to have fewer, well-defined types than many poorly-defined ones\n    - Each type should have a clear, distinct purpose and detailed description\n    - Each type should be distinguishable from others in meaningful ways\n    - Every type you create should be useful for analysis and querying\n    - The numbers above are guidelines, not requirements - use your judgment\n    \n    SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS:\n    Before finalizing your ontology, ask yourself:\n    1. Can I clearly explain when to use each entity type vs. others?\n    2. Would two different people classify entities consistently with these types?\n    3. Are my relation types capturing distinct semantic relationships?\n    4. Can I extract useful, actionable information with this ontology?\n    5. Is this ontology reusable for similar texts in this domain?\n    6. Does the granularity match the requested scope level?\n    \n    ONTOLOGY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:\n    - Entity types should be nouns representing concrete or abstract concepts\n    - Relation types should be verbs or verb phrases that connect entities\n    - Each relation type must specify its domain (subject entity type) and range (object entity type)\n    - Prefer commonly understood terms over jargon unless domain-specific terms are essential\n    - Think about what would be useful for querying and analyzing this type of text\n    - Ensure descriptions are clear and detailed enough for accurate extraction\n    \n    Your task is to analyze THIS specific text and recommend the most appropriate ontology for it,\n    following the principles above and designing for the requested \"{{ scope }}\" scope level.\n    \n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\n// Function to analyze if an existing ontology needs extension for new text\nfunction AnalyzeOntologyExtension(\n  text: string,\n  current_ontology: Ontology,\n  scope: string\n) -> OntologyExtension {\n  client CustomSonnet4\n  prompt #\"\n    You are a knowledge graph ontology expert.

Start with the assumption that the existing ontology is sufficient\n       - Only recommend extension if absolutely necessary\n       - Prefer using existing types creatively over adding new ones\n    \n    2. **Critical Information Test**\n       - Extension is ONLY justified if failing to extend would result in losing CRITICAL information\n       - Ask: \"Can the essential facts be captured with existing types?\"\n       - If yes → No extension needed\n       - If no → Consider extension\n    \n    3. **Definition of Critical Information**\n       Critical information is information that:\n       - Is central to understanding the text's main points\n       - Cannot be reasonably represented with existing entity/relation types\n       - Would create significant semantic loss if omitted or forced into existing types\n       - Is not a minor detail or edge case\n    \n    4. **Examples of When Extension IS Needed**\n       - New text discusses \"Chemical Compounds\" but ontology only has \"Substance\"\n         → If chemical-specific relationships matter, extend\n       - New text has \"Software\" entities but ontology only has \"Product\"\n         → If software-specific attributes/relations are critical, extend\n       - New text introduces entirely new domain (e.g., legal domain in a medical ontology)\n         → If domain is central to the text, extend\n    \n    5. **Examples of When Extension is NOT Needed**\n       - New text mentions \"tablets\" but ontology has \"Device\" → Use Device\n       - New text has \"acquired_by\" but ontology has \"purchased_by\" → Use existing similar relation\n       - New text mentions a rare entity type appearing once → Don't extend for one-offs\n       - Differences are purely syntactic (naming) not semantic → Don't extend\n    \n    6. **Backward Compatibility**\n       Any new types you recommend must:\n       - Be distinct from existing types (not redundant or overlapping)\n       - Follow the same naming and description conventions\n       - Work alongside existing types without conflicts\n       - Be at the appropriate granularity level for the scope\n    \n    7. **Scope Awareness**\n       Consider the current scope ({{ scope }}):\n       - For \"minimal\" scope: Be VERY conservative, only extend for major gaps\n       - For \"balanced\" scope: Extend if missing significant concepts\n       - For \"comprehensive\" scope: More willing to add nuanced types\n    \n    ANALYSIS PROCESS:\n    \n    Step 1: Identify concepts in the new text\n    Step 2: For each concept, try to map it to existing entity types\n    Step 3: For each relationship, try to map it to existing relation types\n    Step 4: Identify any critical information that CANNOT be captured\n    Step 5: If critical gaps exist, propose minimal extensions\n    Step 6: Justify why each extension is necessary\n    \n    DECISION CRITERIA:\n    \n    Set needs_extension = true ONLY if:\n    ✓ There are concepts in the text that are critically important\n    ✓ These concepts cannot be reasonably mapped to existing types\n    ✓ Omitting them would cause significant information loss\n    ✓ The extensions align with the current scope level\n    \n    Set needs_extension = false if:\n    ✓ All critical information can be captured with existing types\n    ✓ Minor details might be lost but core facts are preserved\n    ✓ Existing types can be used flexibly to cover new concepts\n    \n    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n    \n    - If needs_extension = false:\n      * Set new_entity_types and new_relation_types to empty arrays\n      * Explain in reasoning how existing types cover the text\n      * Be specific about which existing types map to which concepts\n    \n    - If needs_extension = true:\n      * Provide ONLY the new types needed (don't repeat existing ones)\n      * Describe in critical_information_at_risk what would be lost\n      * Explain in reasoning why each new type is essential\n      * Keep extensions minimal - only add what's absolutely necessary\n    \n    QUALITY CHECKS:\n    \n    Before recommending extension, verify:\n    1. Can I extract the main facts with existing types? (If yes → no extension)\n    2. Is the \"missing\" information truly critical? (If no → no extension)\n    3. Are my new types distinct from existing ones? (If not → no extension)\n    4. Am I being conservative? (If not → reconsider)\n    \n    Remember: It's better to slightly stretch existing types than to proliferate unnecessary new types.\n    The ontology should evolve slowly and deliberately, not expand with every new text.\n    \n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\n",
