      "    \n",
      "    GRANULARITY GUIDELINES:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Your goal is to design an ontology with balanced scope. Use these principles to guide your decisions about how many types to create and how granular to make them.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ENTITY TYPE GRANULARITY PRINCIPLES:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    1. **Abstraction Level**: Choose the right level of abstraction\n",
      "       - Too broad: \"Thing\", \"Entity\" (not useful)\n",
      "       - Too narrow: \"SoftwareEngineerAtGoogle\", \"CEOOfTechStartup\" (overfitting)\n",
      "       - Just right: \"Person\", \"Organization\", \"JobRole\" (reusable across instances)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. **Domain Relevance**: Include entity types that are central to THIS domain\n",
      "       - For medical text: Patient, Medication, Condition, Procedure, Hospital\n",
      "       - For business text: Company, Person, Investment, Product, Market\n",
      "       - Don't include types that rarely appear or aren't relevant to this specific text\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. **Distinctiveness Test**: Only create separate types if they have:\n",
      "       - Different attributes or characteristics\n",
      "       - Different relationship patterns\n",
      "       - Different analytical value\n",
      "       - Example: \"Professor\" and \"Student\" are distinct if their relationships differ\n",
      "       - Example: \"CEO\" and \"CTO\" might both be \"ExecutiveRole\" if relationships are similar\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. **Generalization**: Combine similar concepts under broader types when appropriate\n",
      "       - Instead of: \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\" → use \"Animal\" (if distinctions don't matter)\n",
      "       - Instead of: \"Laptop\", \"Desktop\", \"Tablet\" → use \"Device\" or \"Computer\"\n",
      "       - BUT: Keep separate if the distinction is analytically important for this domain\n",
      "    \n",
      "    5. **Coverage**: Ensure types cover the main concepts in the text\n",
      "       - Don't create types for concepts that appear only once\n",
      "       - DO create types for recurring or structurally important concepts\n",
      "       - Focus on concepts that are central to understanding this domain\n",
      "    \n",
      "    RELATION TYPE GRANULARITY PRINCIPLES:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    1. **Semantic Precision**: Relations should capture meaningful distinctions\n",
      "       - Too vague: \"related_to\", \"associated_with\" (not informative)\n",
      "       - Too specific: \"works_at_as_senior_engineer_since_2020\" (overfitting)\n",
      "       - Just right: \"works_at\", \"employed_by\", \"manages\" (clear semantics)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. **Directionality Matters**: Choose direction that reflects real-world semantics\n",
      "       - \"Person works_at Organization\" (natural)\n",
      "       - Not \"Organization employs Person\" (unless that's the focus)\n",
      "       - Be consistent in your directional choices\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. **Relationship Patterns**: Include relations that appear or could appear multiple times\n",
      "       - Medical: \"treats\", \"prescribes\", \"diagnoses\", \"hospitalized_at\"\n",
      "       - Business: \"invests_in\", \"founded\", \"acquired_by\", \"partners_with\"\n",
      "       - Focus on the relationships that matter for this domain\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't create near-synonyms unless there's semantic distinction\n",
      "       - Don't have both \"works_at\" and \"employed_by\" (pick one)\n",
      "       - Don't have both \"located_in\" and \"based_in\" (pick one)\n",
      "       - DO have \"founded\" and \"acquired\" (different events with different meanings)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    5. **Completeness**: Capture the key relationship types in the domain\n",
      "       - Think: \"What questions would someone ask about this data?\"\n",
      "       - Include relations that support those analytical questions\n",
      "       - Every relation should serve a clear analytical purpose\n",
      "    \n",
      "    SCOPE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    **If scope is \"minimal\":**\n",
      "    - Create only the most essential entity types (core concepts only)\n",
      "    - Focus on the most frequent and important relationships\n",
      "    - Err on the side of broader categories that combine similar concepts\n",
      "    - Typical result: 3-8 entity types, 4-10 relation types\n",
      "    - Use case: Quick extraction, simple queries, identifying broad patterns\n",
      "    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, works_at, located_in\n",
      "    \n",
      "    **If scope is \"balanced\":**\n",
      "    - Include entity types for all significant concepts in the domain\n",
      "    - Capture the main relationship patterns without over-specifying\n",
      "    - Balance specificity with reusability across similar texts\n",
      "    - Typical result: 6-12 entity types, 8-15 relation types\n",
      "    - Use case: Standard analysis, general-purpose extraction, most common scenarios\n",
      "    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, Product, Investment, works_at, located_in, founded, invests_in, develops\n",
      "    \n",
      "    **If scope is \"comprehensive\":**\n",
      "    - Include entity types for all distinct and meaningful concepts\n",
      "    - Capture nuanced relationship types that reflect domain expertise\n",
      "    - Allow for more domain-specific and specialized types\n",
      "    - Typical result: 10-20 entity types, 12-25 relation types\n",
      "    - Use case: Detailed analysis, domain expertise, research, specialized queries\n",
      "    - Example: For a business article → Person, Organization, Location, Product, Investment, Technology, Market, Role, works_at, located_in, founded, invests_in, develops, competes_with, targets, acquired_by, partners_with\n",
      "    \n",
      "    QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:\n",
      "    - It's better to have fewer, well-defined types than many poorly-defined ones\n",
      "    - Each type should have a clear, distinct purpose and detailed description\n",
      "    - Each type should be distinguishable from others in meaningful ways\n",
      "    - Every type you create should be useful for analysis and querying\n",
      "    - The numbers above are guidelines, not requirements - use your judgment\n",
      "    \n",
      "    SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS:\n",
      "    Before finalizing your ontology, ask yourself:\n",
      "    1. Can I clearly explain when to use each entity type vs. others?\n",
      "    2. Would two different people classify entities consistently with these types?\n",
      "    3. Are my relation types capturing distinct semantic relationships?\n",
      "    4. Can I extract useful, actionable information with this ontology?\n",
      "    5. Is this ontology reusable for similar texts in this domain?\n",
      "    6. Does the granularity match the requested scope level?\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ONTOLOGY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:\n",
      "    - Entity types should be nouns representing concrete or abstract concepts\n",
      "    - Relation types should be verbs or verb phrases that connect entities\n",
      "    - Each relation type must specify its domain (subject entity type) and range (object entity type)\n",
      "    - Prefer commonly understood terms over jargon unless domain-specific terms are essential\n",
      "    - Think about what would be useful for querying and analyzing this type of text\n",
      "    - Ensure descriptions are clear and detailed enough for accurate extraction\n",
      "    \n",
      "    CUSTOM ATTRIBUTES FOR ENTITY TYPES:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For each entity type, you should define custom attributes that capture type-specific information:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    1. **Identify Key Attributes**: What information is important for this entity type?\n",
      "       - For Person: birth_date, nationality, occupation\n",
      "       - For Organization: founded_date, headquarters_location, industry\n",
      "       - For Campaign: launch_date, end_date, budget, target_audience\n",
      "       - For Product: release_date, version, price\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. **Attribute Types**: Use appropriate data types\n",
      "       - \"string\": General text (names, descriptions, IDs)\n",
      "       - \"int\": Whole numbers (counts, quantities, years)\n",
      "       - \"float\": Decimal numbers (prices, percentages, measurements)\n",
      "       - \"bool\": True/false values (is_active, is_public)\n",
      "       - \"date\": ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n",
      "       - Nested objects: For complex structured data (use JSON schema description)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. **Domain-Relevant Attributes**: Focus on what matters for this domain\n",
      "       - Medical domain: diagnosis_date, treatment_status, dosage\n",
      "       - Business domain: funding_amount, employee_count, revenue\n",
      "       - Academic domain: publication_date, citation_count, affiliation\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. **Extraction-Friendly**: Choose attributes that can be extracted from text\n",
      "       - Prefer attributes commonly mentioned in text\n",
      "       - Avoid attributes requiring external knowledge\n",
      "       - Balance detail with extractability\n",
      "    \n",
      "    5. **Scope Considerations**:\n",
      "       - Minimal scope: 0-2 attributes per entity type (only essential ones)\n",
      "       - Balanced scope: 2-4 attributes per entity type (common, useful attributes)\n",
      "       - Comprehensive scope: 4-8 attributes per entity type (detailed characterization)\n",

      "Reasoning:\n",
      "  I designed a balanced ontology focused on clinical research and related entities that appear in the text. Entity types were chosen to cover recurring and central concepts: persons (investigators/presenters), organizations (hospital, FDA, professional society), clinical trials (study-level metadata), medications, medical conditions, outcomes (endpoints/results), adverse events (side effects), biological targets (mechanism), events (conferences), regulatory actions (expected reviews), and locations. This set is general enough to apply across similar clinical-trial reports yet specific enough to capture analytically important distinctions (e.g., outcomes vs. adverse events, trials vs. medications). Relation types were selected to reflect common, meaningful interactions in clinical reports: affiliations (works_at), trial leadership, which organization conducted a trial, trial→medication and trial→condition links, how outcomes map to conditions, reporting of adverse events, mechanism links (medication→target), presentation/reporting at conferences, and regulatory review actions. Attribute choices follow the 'balanced' guideline (2–4 useful, extractable attributes per entity) emphasizing information commonly present in such texts (enrollment counts, age ranges, duration, effect sizes, incidence percentages, mechanism descriptions, and expected regulatory dates). The ontology avoids overly specific roles or redundant relations while supporting typical queries: Who led the trial? Where was it conducted? What medication and mechanism were studied? What were the efficacy and side-effect rates? Has the FDA or another agency been engaged? This design should allow consistent classification by different annotators and be reusable across similar clinical trial summaries.\n",

      "      \"reasoning\": \"I designed a balanced ontology focused on clinical research and related entities that appear in the text. Entity types were chosen to cover recurring and central concepts: persons (investigators/presenters), organizations (hospital, FDA, professional society), clinical trials (study-level metadata), medications, medical conditions, outcomes (endpoints/results), adverse events (side effects), biological targets (mechanism), events (conferences), regulatory actions (expected reviews), and locations. This set is general enough to apply across similar clinical-trial reports yet specific enough to capture analytically important distinctions (e.g., outcomes vs. adverse events, trials vs. medications). Relation types were selected to reflect common, meaningful interactions in clinical reports: affiliations (works_at), trial leadership, which organization conducted a trial, trial→medication and trial→condition links, how outcomes map to conditions, reporting of adverse events, mechanism links (medication→target), presentation/reporting at conferences, and regulatory review actions. Attribute choices follow the 'balanced' guideline (2–4 useful, extractable attributes per entity) emphasizing information commonly present in such texts (enrollment counts, age ranges, duration, effect sizes, incidence percentages, mechanism descriptions, and expected regulatory dates). The ontology avoids overly specific roles or redundant relations while supporting typical queries: Who led the trial? Where was it conducted? What medication and mechanism were studied? What were the efficacy and side-effect rates? Has the FDA or another agency been engaged? This design should allow consistent classification by different annotators and be reusable across similar clinical trial summaries.\"\n",

Entity types were chosen to cover recurring and central concepts: persons (investigators/presenters), organizations (hospital, FDA, professional society), clinical trials (study-level metadata), medications, medical conditions, outcomes (endpoints/results), adverse events (side effects), biological targets (mechanism), events (conferences), regulatory actions (expected reviews), and locations. This set is general enough to apply across similar clinical-trial reports yet specific enough to capture analytically important distinctions (e.g., outcomes vs. adverse events, trials vs. medications). Relation types were selected to reflect common, meaningful interactions in clinical reports: affiliations (works_at), trial leadership, which organization conducted a trial, trial→medication and trial→condition links, how outcomes map to conditions, reporting of adverse events, mechanism links (medication→target), presentation/reporting at conferences, and regulatory review actions. Attribute choices follow the 'balanced' guideline (2–4 useful, extractable attributes per entity) emphasizing information commonly present in such texts (enrollment counts, age ranges, duration, effect sizes, incidence percentages, mechanism descriptions, and expected regulatory dates). The ontology avoids overly specific roles or redundant relations while supporting typical queries: Who led the trial? Where was it conducted? What medication and mechanism were studied? What were the efficacy and side-effect rates? Has the FDA or another agency been engaged? This design should allow consistent classification by different annotators and be reusable across similar clinical trial summaries.\"\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"I designed a balanced ontology focused on clinical research and related entities that appear in the text. Entity types were chosen to cover recurring and central concepts: persons (investigators/presenters), organizations (hospital, FDA, professional society), clinical trials (study-level metadata), medications, medical conditions, outcomes (endpoints/results), adverse events (side effects), biological targets (mechanism), events (conferences), regulatory actions (expected reviews), and locations. This set is general enough to apply across similar clinical-trial reports yet specific enough to capture analytically important distinctions (e.g., outcomes vs. adverse events, trials vs. medications). Relation types were selected to reflect common, meaningful interactions in clinical reports: affiliations (works_at), trial leadership, which organization conducted a trial, trial\\u2192medication and trial\\u2192condition links, how outcomes map to conditions, reporting of adverse events, mechanism links (medication\\u2192target), presentation/reporting at conferences, and regulatory review actions. Attribute choices follow the 'balanced' guideline (2\\u20134 useful, extractable attributes per entity) emphasizing information commonly present in such texts (enrollment counts, age ranges, duration, effect sizes, incidence percentages, mechanism descriptions, and expected regulatory dates). The ontology avoids overly specific roles or redundant relations while supporting typical queries: Who led the trial? Where was it conducted? What medication and mechanism were studied? What were the efficacy and side-effect rates? Has the FDA or another agency been engaged? This design should allow consistent classification by different annotators and be reusable across similar clinical trial summaries.\"\n",
