Where a new concept is closely related to existing entries (for example, 'convolutional neural network' relates to the existing 'neural network' and 'deep learning' terms), I created a separate entry because it is a specific architecture type that warrants its own definition and added the common abbreviation 'CNN' as a synonym.

Required fields are minimal and focus on core discovery and processing: title and language are required to identify and interpret content; content_sections is required to represent the document's logical structure for navigation and downstream parsing. Structural metadata includes counts and file/encoding details to help automated pipelines and layout-aware extraction. Descriptive metadata covers abstract, keywords, topics, named entities, key concepts and specialized model mentions to support faceted search, classification and semantic indexing. Administrative metadata (creation/modification dates, author, source_provenance, rights, version) supports lineage, access control and maintenance. Data types are chosen for machine validation (string, int, date, list). Element identifiers follow the specified \\\"meta_[index]\\\" format and are unique. Fields marked required are those that enable basic indexing and language-aware processing across diverse document collections; other fields are optional but recommended for richer discovery and governance.\"\n",

Required fields are minimal and focus on core discovery and processing: title and language are required to identify and interpret content; content_sections is required to represent the document's logical structure for navigation and downstream parsing. Structural metadata includes counts and file/encoding details to help automated pipelines and layout-aware extraction. Descriptive metadata covers abstract, keywords, topics, named entities, key concepts and specialized model mentions to support faceted search, classification and semantic indexing. Administrative metadata (creation/modification dates, author, source_provenance, rights, version) supports lineage, access control and maintenance. Data types are chosen for machine validation (string, int, date, list). Element identifiers follow the specified \\\"meta_[index]\\\" format and are unique. Fields marked required are those that enable basic indexing and language-aware processing across diverse document collections; other fields are optional but recommended for richer discovery and governance.\"\n",

            "      \"reasoning\": \"Structure follows IS-A (broader-narrower) hierarchy constrained to vocabulary items and the provided context. 'Artificial intelligence' is the top-level technical concept and thus a root. Machine learning is a direct subset of AI; deep learning, neural networks, and the supervised/unsupervised categories are placed under machine learning per the context and domain knowledge (high confidence). Tasks (classification, regression, clustering) are children of their respective learning categories (high). Popular frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) are placed under deep learning because the context explicitly names them as deep learning frameworks (high). Neural-network architectures (convolutional, residual, transformer) are placed under 'neural network' (high). Computer vision and natural language processing are subfields of AI (high); CV tasks (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation) are children of computer vision (high), and YOLO is a specific object detection family (high). Application areas (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) are linked to AI or computer vision as appropriate; these are pragmatic application-level IS-A placements and thus marked medium confidence where the IS-A reading is less strict. Data terms (labeled training data, unlabeled data) and technique/component terms (attention mechanism, large language model) are related to the learning categories or transformer models but some of these are closer to 'used by' or 'component of' relationships rather than pure IS-A; such links are marked medium confidence to reflect that nuance. Companies (Google, Meta) have no broader concept in the vocabulary and are therefore roots. Each child has only one parent to maintain a strict hierarchy.\"\n",

'Artificial intelligence' is the top-level technical concept and thus a root. Machine learning is a direct subset of AI; deep learning, neural networks, and the supervised/unsupervised categories are placed under machine learning per the context and domain knowledge (high confidence). Tasks (classification, regression, clustering) are children of their respective learning categories (high). Popular frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) are placed under deep learning because the context explicitly names them as deep learning frameworks (high). Neural-network architectures (convolutional, residual, transformer) are placed under 'neural network' (high). Computer vision and natural language processing are subfields of AI (high); CV tasks (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation) are children of computer vision (high), and YOLO is a specific object detection family (high). Application areas (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) are linked to AI or computer vision as appropriate; these are pragmatic application-level IS-A placements and thus marked medium confidence where the IS-A reading is less strict. Data terms (labeled training data, unlabeled data) and technique/component terms (attention mechanism, large language model) are related to the learning categories or transformer models but some of these are closer to 'used by' or 'component of' relationships rather than pure IS-A; such links are marked medium confidence to reflect that nuance. Companies (Google, Meta) have no broader concept in the vocabulary and are therefore roots. Each child has only one parent to maintain a strict hierarchy.\"\n",

'Artificial intelligence' is the primary root under which core methodological concepts (machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing) are placed because these are established subfields of AI (high confidence). 'Machine learning' is the parent of algorithmic families and learning paradigms (deep learning, neural network, supervised and unsupervised learning) (high). Supervised/unsupervised children include their canonical tasks (classification, regression, clustering) (high). Neural-network families and architectures are placed under 'neural network' (CNN, transformer) with architecture variants (ResNet under CNN) and techniques (attention under neural network) (high/medium as indicated). Transformer models commonly underlie large language models, so LLM is placed under transformer model (medium). 'Labeled training data' and 'unlabeled data' were attached to supervised and unsupervised learning respectively with medium confidence because they are data types associated with those paradigms (these are closely related but not pure IS-A in the strictest sense). Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and companies (Google, Meta) were left as roots because the vocabulary does not include a suitable broader concept (e.g., 'deep learning framework' or 'company') and assigning them under methodological concepts would create non-IS-A relations (tool/producer vs. concept). Application items mentioned in the context (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) were left as roots for the same reason: they are application domains that use computer vision and ML but are not strictly types of those methods. Confidence levels reflect how directly the hierarchical IS-A relationship is supported by domain knowledge or required inference.\"\n",

            "      \"reasoning\": \"I constructed a strict IS-A hierarchy following the provided principles. 'Artificial intelligence' is the primary root under which core methodological concepts (machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing) are placed because these are established subfields of AI (high confidence). 'Machine learning' is the parent of algorithmic families and learning paradigms (deep learning, neural network, supervised and unsupervised learning) (high). Supervised/unsupervised children include their canonical tasks (classification, regression, clustering) (high). Neural-network families and architectures are placed under 'neural network' (CNN, transformer) with architecture variants (ResNet under CNN) and techniques (attention under neural network) (high/medium as indicated). Transformer models commonly underlie large language models, so LLM is placed under transformer model (medium). 'Labeled training data' and 'unlabeled data' were attached to supervised and unsupervised learning respectively with medium confidence because they are data types associated with those paradigms (these are closely related but not pure IS-A in the strictest sense). Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and companies (Google, Meta) were left as roots because the vocabulary does not include a suitable broader concept (e.g., 'deep learning framework' or 'company') and assigning them under methodological concepts would create non-IS-A relations (tool/producer vs. concept). Application items mentioned in the context (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) were left as roots for the same reason: they are application domains that use computer vision and ML but are not strictly types of those methods. Confidence levels reflect how directly the hierarchical IS-A relationship is supported by domain knowledge or required inference.\"\n",

USE/USe_FOR (synonym) entries come from the provided synonyms for each vocabulary term. Broader Term (BT) and Narrower Term (NT) hierarchical relationships were created to represent 'is-a' or subfield relationships (for example, machine learning is a narrower concept under artificial intelligence; deep learning is a narrower concept under machine learning; CNN, ResNet, and transformer are types of neural networks). When a concept is clearly an application area or subfield (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) it was placed as a narrower term of artificial intelligence. Related Term (RT) associative links were used for concepts frequently discussed together in the provided context or domain (e.g., TensorFlow related to Google and PyTorch; transformer models related to NLP and attention mechanisms; LLMs related to transformer models and NLP). RTs were avoided where a BT/NT already expressed the hierarchical relation. Scope notes are taken or lightly adapted from the provided vocabulary definitions to provide definitional clarification. The taxonomy_relations provided in the prompt used placeholder IDs and could not be directly mapped to these vocabulary labels, so hierarchical structure was created based on the domain semantics present in the vocabulary and context text.\"\n",

Broader Term (BT) and Narrower Term (NT) hierarchical relationships were created to represent 'is-a' or subfield relationships (for example, machine learning is a narrower concept under artificial intelligence; deep learning is a narrower concept under machine learning; CNN, ResNet, and transformer are types of neural networks). When a concept is clearly an application area or subfield (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) it was placed as a narrower term of artificial intelligence. Related Term (RT) associative links were used for concepts frequently discussed together in the provided context or domain (e.g., TensorFlow related to Google and PyTorch; transformer models related to NLP and attention mechanisms; LLMs related to transformer models and NLP). RTs were avoided where a BT/NT already expressed the hierarchical relation. Scope notes are taken or lightly adapted from the provided vocabulary definitions to provide definitional clarification.

High-level concepts from the vocabulary (artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning) become ResearchArea and Technique to preserve hierarchical semantics. Concrete constructs used in the thesaurus (neural network, transformer, convolutional neural network, YOLO, ResNet, large language model) are modeled as ModelArchitecture to capture architecture-specific attributes and variant/contains relations. Software artifacts (TensorFlow, PyTorch) are captured as Framework with developer links to Organization (Google, Meta) inferred from the vocabulary. Data artifacts (labeled training data, unlabeled data) are modeled as Dataset with label_status to support supervised vs unsupervised distinctions. Tasks (classification, regression, clustering, object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, facial recognition) and ApplicationDomain (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, security) capture actionable and applied aspects. Components such as attention mechanism are modeled as Component to enable has_component relations (supported by thesaurus RT links). Relation types were derived from the thesaurus RT/BT patterns (e.g., related_to, is_subfield_of, variant_of, implemented_by/developed_by, trained_on, performs_task, applied_in). Domain/range constraints ensure semantic coherence (e.g., trained_on connects ModelArchitecture->Dataset). The ontology targets a balanced scope (9 entity types, 12 relations) and defines attributes that help extract core facts useful for building a knowledge graph from the corpus (names, definitions, provenance, typical tasks, supervision and dataset properties).\"\n",

High-level concepts from the vocabulary (artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning) become ResearchArea and Technique to preserve hierarchical semantics. Concrete constructs used in the thesaurus (neural network, transformer, convolutional neural network, YOLO, ResNet, large language model) are modeled as ModelArchitecture to capture architecture-specific attributes and variant/contains relations. Software artifacts (TensorFlow, PyTorch) are captured as Framework with developer links to Organization (Google, Meta) inferred from the vocabulary. Data artifacts (labeled training data, unlabeled data) are modeled as Dataset with label_status to support supervised vs unsupervised distinctions. Tasks (classification, regression, clustering, object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, facial recognition) and ApplicationDomain (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, security) capture actionable and applied aspects. Components such as attention mechanism are modeled as Component to enable has_component relations (supported by thesaurus RT links). Relation types were derived from the thesaurus RT/BT patterns (e.g., related_to, is_subfield_of, variant_of, implemented_by/developed_by, trained_on, performs_task, applied_in). Domain/range constraints ensure semantic coherence (e.g., trained_on connects ModelArchitecture->Dataset).

            "      \"reasoning\": \"Design choices were driven directly by the controlled vocabulary and thesaurus relationships. High-level vocabulary terms (artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing) are modeled as the Field entity to capture the root taxonomy. Distinct technical concepts that function as techniques or patterns (deep learning, neural network, attention mechanism) become Method, while concrete network families and named model families (CNN, ResNet, Transformer, YOLO) are ModelArchitecture — this separation preserves the method-to-architecture RT chains in the thesaurus. Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and Organizations (Google, Meta) are explicit entities because thesaurus entries and RT links indicate developer/framework relationships. Tasks (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation, NLP) and Applications (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) are separate to capture mappings from tasks to real-world use-cases shown in the sample text and RT links. Dataset and LearningParadigm entities capture labeled/unlabeled data and supervised/unsupervised distinctions that appear across the vocabulary. Relation types were derived from RT patterns (e.g., 'RT' implying a topical association became supports_task, implements_method, has_architecture, trained_on, used_by/developed_by). Domain and range constraints were chosen to reflect the semantics in the thesaurus (e.g., Method -> ModelArchitecture for 'has_architecture', Framework -> Organization for 'developed_by'). Attribute selections prioritize extraction-friendly primitives (names, short descriptions, developer, year, label_type, size_estimate, input/output modalities) so entities are informative for downstream knowledge graph tasks while staying within the requested scope (9 entity types, 13 relation types). This design balances granularity (separating method vs architecture vs framework) with practical extraction considerations guided by the existing controlled vocabulary and RT/BT structure.\"\n",

High-level vocabulary terms (artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing) are modeled as the Field entity to capture the root taxonomy. Distinct technical concepts that function as techniques or patterns (deep learning, neural network, attention mechanism) become Method, while concrete network families and named model families (CNN, ResNet, Transformer, YOLO) are ModelArchitecture — this separation preserves the method-to-architecture RT chains in the thesaurus. Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and Organizations (Google, Meta) are explicit entities because thesaurus entries and RT links indicate developer/framework relationships. Tasks (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation, NLP) and Applications (autonomous vehicle, medical imaging, facial recognition) are separate to capture mappings from tasks to real-world use-cases shown in the sample text and RT links. Dataset and LearningParadigm entities capture labeled/unlabeled data and supervised/unsupervised distinctions that appear across the vocabulary. Relation types were derived from RT patterns (e.g., 'RT' implying a topical association became supports_task, implements_method, has_architecture, trained_on, used_by/developed_by). Domain and range constraints were chosen to reflect the semantics in the thesaurus (e.g., Method -> ModelArchitecture for 'has_architecture', Framework -> Organization for 'developed_by'). Attribute selections prioritize extraction-friendly primitives (names, short descriptions, developer, year, label_type, size_estimate, input/output modalities) so entities are informative for downstream knowledge graph tasks while staying within the requested scope (9 entity types, 13 relation types). This design balances granularity (separating method vs architecture vs framework) with practical extraction considerations guided by the existing controlled vocabulary and RT/BT structure.\"\n",

            "      \"reasoning\": \"I extracted entities and relations directly supported by the provided text and mapped them to the ontology types and relation constraints. Key decisions and evidence:\\n\\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is present in the text, but the ontology expects ResearchArea entities; I therefore created 'Transformer' and 'Large Language Models (LLMs)' as ModelArchitecture entities because the text explicitly calls them 'models'. The text explicitly states: \\\"Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language.\\\" This informed the NLP ResearchArea metadata (not directly used in a relation because the ontology does not provide a ResearchArea-to-ResearchArea relation).\\n\\n- Transformer: The sentence \\\"Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, enabling breakthrough applications like GPT and BERT.\\\" identifies Transformers and links them to GPT and BERT. I created a Transformer ModelArchitecture entity and used this span to support variant_of relations for GPT/BERT and the performs_task triple for language tasks.\\n\\n- GPT-4, PaLM, Gemini: The sentence \\\"OpenAI developed GPT-4, while Google created PaLM and Gemini.\\\" directly supports developed_by relations linking those model entities to the corresponding Organization entities (OpenAI, Google). I reused the exact organization names (OpenAI, Google). Where the text names products, I placed them into the organizations' notable_products attribute when directly supported by the sentence.\\n\\n- Attention mechanism: The sentence \\\"These models use attention mechanisms to process sequential data effectively.\\\" supports has_component relations between the attention mechanism component and Transformer, LLMs, and the specific models (GPT-4, PaLM, Gemini). I included that span along with model-identifying spans when linking specific models to the component to make the referent clear.\\n\\n- LLMs and datasets/tasks: The sentence \\\"Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive text datasets and can generate human-like text, answer questions, and perform various language tasks.\\\" supports multiple triples: LLMs trained_on Massive text datasets, and LLMs performs_task Text generation, Question answering, and Language tasks. It also supports dataset_for links from the 'Massive text datasets' Dataset entity to the tasks Text generation and Question answering.\\n\\n- Variant_of relations: The phrase that transformer models enable applications like GPT and BERT supports GPT and BERT being variants/instantiations of the Transformer architecture. For GPT-4, I used combined spans (the transformer sentence and the sentence naming GPT-4) to show the connection between the named model and the Transformer family; similarly for PaLM and Gemini the combination of the transformer sentence and the sentence listing PaLM and Gemini supports them being transformer-based.\\n\\n- Entity metadata: For each entity I filled all custom attributes required by the ontology. If the text did not mention a given attribute (for example, founded_year or dataset size), I set the attribute value to null as required. All string attributes are typed as \\\"string\\\" and integer attributes as \\\"int\\\" where present; no dates were provided in the text.\\n\\n- Ontology compliance: I ensured relation domain and range constraints were respected (e.g., performs_task used from ModelArchitecture to Task, trained_on from ModelArchitecture to Dataset, has_component from ModelArchitecture to Component, developed_by from ModelArchitecture to Organization, dataset_for from Dataset to Task, variant_of between ModelArchitecture entities).\\n\\n- Supporting spans: For each triple I included exact text spans from the source that support the asserted fact. Where a fact is supported by multiple parts of the text (for example, identifying a specific model and separately stating that \\\"these models\\\" use attention), I included multiple supporting_spans to make the evidence clear.\\n\\nNotes and conservative choices:\\n- I avoided asserting any relations not directly supported by the text (for example, I did not assert NLP is_subfield_of Artificial Intelligence using the provided is_subfield_of relation because that relation is defined Domain: Technique -> Range: ResearchArea and the text describes NLP as a ResearchArea; there is no appropriate relation in the ontology for ResearchArea->ResearchArea subfield links).\\n- I used the exact names provided in the text. For entities that also appear in the existing triples (e.g., Artificial Intelligence appears in the existing triples), I used the same canonical name when relevant.\\n\\nIf you would like, I can: (a) add an explicit ResearchArea entity for \\\"Natural language processing (NLP)\\\" with its attributes (it is present implicitly in the descriptions), (b) add further linking triples (e.g., marking LLMs as variant_of Transformer if you want that explicit assertion), or (c) normalize variant names (e.g., include both \\\"GPT\\\" and \\\"GPT-4\\\") across triples. I can also produce character offsets for the supporting spans if you want those computed.\"\n",

            "      \"reasoning\": \"I extracted entities and relations directly supported by the provided text and mapped them to the ontology types and relation constraints. Key decisions and evidence:\\n\\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is present in the text, but the ontology expects ResearchArea entities; I therefore created 'Transformer' and 'Large Language Models (LLMs)' as ModelArchitecture entities because the text explicitly calls them 'models'. The text explicitly states: \\\"Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language.\\\" This informed the NLP ResearchArea metadata (not directly used in a relation because the ontology does not provide a ResearchArea-to-ResearchArea relation).\\n\\n- Transformer: The sentence \\\"Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, enabling breakthrough applications like GPT and BERT.\\\" identifies Transformers and links them to GPT and BERT. I created a Transformer ModelArchitecture entity and used this span to support variant_of relations for GPT/BERT and the performs_task triple for language tasks.\\n\\n- GPT-4, PaLM, Gemini: The sentence \\\"OpenAI developed GPT-4, while Google created PaLM and Gemini.\\\" directly supports developed_by relations linking those model entities to the corresponding Organization entities (OpenAI, Google). I reused the exact organization names (OpenAI, Google). Where the text names products, I placed them into the organizations' notable_products attribute when directly supported by the sentence.\\n\\n- Attention mechanism: The sentence \\\"These models use attention mechanisms to process sequential data effectively.\\\" supports has_component relations between the attention mechanism component and Transformer, LLMs, and the specific models (GPT-4, PaLM, Gemini). I included that span along with model-identifying spans when linking specific models to the component to make the referent clear.\\n\\n- LLMs and datasets/tasks: The sentence \\\"Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive text datasets and can generate human-like text, answer questions, and perform various language tasks.\\\" supports multiple triples: LLMs trained_on Massive text datasets, and LLMs performs_task Text generation, Question answering, and Language tasks. It also supports dataset_for links from the 'Massive text datasets' Dataset entity to the tasks Text generation and Question answering.\\n\\n- Variant_of relations: The phrase that transformer models enable applications like GPT and BERT supports GPT and BERT being variants/instantiations of the Transformer architecture. For GPT-4, I used combined spans (the transformer sentence and the sentence naming GPT-4) to show the connection between the named model and the Transformer family; similarly for PaLM and Gemini the combination of the transformer sentence and the sentence listing PaLM and Gemini supports them being transformer-based.\\n\\n- Entity metadata: For each entity I filled all custom attributes required by the ontology. If the text did not mention a given attribute (for example, founded_year or dataset size), I set the attribute value to null as required. All string attributes are typed as \\\"string\\\" and integer attributes as \\\"int\\\" where present; no dates were provided in the text.\\n\\n- Ontology compliance: I ensured relation domain and range constraints were respected (e.g., performs_task used from ModelArchitecture to Task, trained_on from ModelArchitecture to Dataset, has_component from ModelArchitecture to Component, developed_by from ModelArchitecture to Organization, dataset_for from Dataset to Task, variant_of between ModelArchitecture entities).\\n\\n- Supporting spans: For each triple I included exact text spans from the source that support the asserted fact. Where a fact is supported by multiple parts of the text (for example, identifying a specific model and separately stating that \\\"these models\\\" use attention), I included multiple supporting_spans to make the evidence clear.\\n\\nNotes and conservative choices:\\n- I avoided asserting any relations not directly supported by the text (for example, I did not assert NLP is_subfield_of Artificial Intelligence using the provided is_subfield_of relation because that relation is defined Domain: Technique -> Range: ResearchArea and the text describes NLP as a ResearchArea; there is no appropriate relation in the ontology for ResearchArea->ResearchArea subfield links).\\n- I used the exact names provided in the text. For entities that also appear in the existing triples (e.g., Artificial Intelligence appears in the existing triples), I used the same canonical name when relevant.\\n\\nIf you would like, I can: (a) add an explicit ResearchArea entity for \\\"Natural language processing (NLP)\\\" with its attributes (it is present implicitly in the descriptions), (b) add further linking triples (e.g., marking LLMs as variant_of Transformer if you want that explicit assertion), or (c) normalize variant names (e.g., include both \\\"GPT\\\" and \\\"GPT-4\\\") across triples. I can also produce character offsets for the supporting spans if you want those computed.\"\n",
