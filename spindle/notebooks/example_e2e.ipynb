    "This notebook demonstrated the complete Spindle workflow:\n",

    "✅ **Configuration**: Set up SpindleConfig in `example_project/` directory  \n",
    "✅ **Document Creation**: Created 3 documents with entity variations  \n",
    "✅ **Ingestion**: Ingested documents into document storage and vector storage  \n",
    "✅ **Ontology Recommendation**: Iteratively recommended and extended ontology across documents  \n",
    "✅ **Triple Extraction**: Extracted knowledge graph triples using the final ontology  \n",
    "✅ **Entity Resolution**: Identified and linked duplicate entities (TechCorp variants, John Smith variants)  \n",
    "✅ **Knowledge Graph**: Inserted resolved triples into persistent graph  \n",
    "✅ **Analytics**: Viewed metrics from event logs showing LLM usage and costs  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documents**: 3 documents ingested\n",
    "- **Triples**: Extracted triples with entity consistency\n",
    "- **Entity Resolution**: Found duplicate clusters for company and person name variations\n",
    "- **Knowledge Graph**: Persistent graph with resolved entities and relationships\n",
    "- **Analytics**: Complete observability into LLM operations and costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query the knowledge graph using Cypher queries\n",
    "- Extend the ontology for new document types\n",
    "- Fine-tune entity resolution thresholds\n",
    "- Explore the dashboard for detailed analytics\n",
    "- Export triples for use in other systems\n"
