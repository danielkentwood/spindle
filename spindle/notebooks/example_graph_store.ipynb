From the sentence \\\"She primarily uses Python for backend development and has been with the company for 3 years.\\\" I created a uses triple (Person->Technology) linking Alice Johnson to Python — the pronoun \\\"She\\\" refers to the previously named Alice Johnson, and the sentence explicitly states Python as the technology used. The phrase \\\"has been with the company for 3 years.\\\" supplies the person's years_experience (3), so I populated Alice Johnson's years_experience attribute with integer 3 and left title null because no job title is given. Organization attributes (founded_year, industry) are not mentioned and are set to null. For each triple I included the exact text spans from the source that support the relation; character indices are left null for post-processing. Entity names were normalized to full forms as they appear in the text and reused exactly where the same entity appears across triples to ensure consistency.\"\n",

From the sentence \\\"She primarily uses Python for backend development and has been with the company for 3 years.\\\" I created a uses triple (Person->Technology) linking Alice Johnson to Python — the pronoun \\\"She\\\" refers to the previously named Alice Johnson, and the sentence explicitly states Python as the technology used. The phrase \\\"has been with the company for 3 years.\\\" supplies the person's years_experience (3), so I populated Alice Johnson's years_experience attribute with integer 3 and left title null because no job title is given. Organization attributes (founded_year, industry) are not mentioned and are set to null. For each triple I included the exact text spans from the source that support the relation; character indices are left null for post-processing.
