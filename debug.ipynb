    "    In recent months, Alice Johnson has been expanding her technical expertise \n",

    "    large-scale applications. Alice has been particularly impressed with how \n",
    "    TypeScript enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors in \n",
    "    TechCorp's growing codebase. She's now advocating for TypeScript adoption \n",
    "    across the entire engineering organization and has been conducting internal \n",
    "    workshops to help other developers make the transition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Meanwhile, TechCorp has been experiencing remarkable growth and recently \n",
    "    announced plans to expand its operations beyond the West Coast. The company \n",
    "    revealed that it will be opening a new office in New York City, specifically \n",
    "    in Manhattan's Flatiron District. This new location will serve as TechCorp's \n",
    "    East Coast headquarters and is expected to house sales, business development, \n",

    "    grown from a small startup to a company with over 250 employees and a \n",
    "    valuation exceeding $500 million. Bob remains hands-on in the company's \n",
    "    day-to-day operations and is known for his open-door policy and regular \n",
    "    engagement with employees at all levels. He's been particularly focused on \n",
    "    maintaining TechCorp's startup culture even as the company scales, emphasizing \n",
    "    innovation, collaboration, and technical excellence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The expansion to New York represents a significant milestone for TechCorp \n",
    "    and reflects the company's ambitions to compete more effectively on the East \n",

    "    to be closer to major financial services clients and to tap into New York's \n",
    "    diverse talent pool. Alice has been asked to help set up the engineering \n",
